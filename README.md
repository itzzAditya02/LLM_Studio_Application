# LLM Studio - Unified AI Assistant Tool

This Visual Studio Code extension allows developers to:

- Interact with multiple LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral, DeepSeek, Gemini, etc.)
- Compare responses from different models side by side
- Use a modern React-based UI inside a VS Code webview panel

⚠️ This is currently for internal use and under development.
